# Google Main Search Page

The Google Main Search Page is a static web page created as an assignment project during the Harvard CS50 Web development course. 
The web page is designed to resemble the Google main search page and is created using HTML and CSS. The page includes a search bar and buttons for Google Search and I'm Feeling Lucky. The page also includes links to various Google services such as Gmail, Images, and News. The CSS styling includes the use of the colors, and fonts.

The project aims to provide practical experience in HTML and CSS and a web page that resembles a real-world example.
