Pages:one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
On the Google Search page, there will be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.
Query Text: On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Search”, and will be taken to the Google search results for that page.
Query Images. On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and will be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
Query Advanced. On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
Find pages with… “all these words:”
Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
Find pages with… “any of these words:”
Find pages with… “none of these words:”
Lucky. Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
